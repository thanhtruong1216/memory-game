# This game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

# A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

# The game displays from 1 to 3 stars that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, display 3 stars. After 15 moves, change to a 2 star rating. After 20 moves, change to a 1 star rating. Each pair of 2 clicks is 1 move.
