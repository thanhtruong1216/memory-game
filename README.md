# Memory Game Project

This game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

The game displays from 1 to 3 stars that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, star rating display three stars. After 15 moves, star rating change to two stars. After 20 moves, star rating change to one star. Each pair of clicks is a move.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
